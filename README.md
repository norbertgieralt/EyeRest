## User stories
1. As an unsigned user with no internet connection I want to be notified (by graphic and sound notification) after 1 hour of work that it's time to have a 5 minuts break in order to not forget to make a 5 minutes break for my eyes after each hour.
2. As an unsigned user with no internet connection I want to be able to stop time counting, restart work or break period, or go to the next period in order to be able to use the app flexiby when I need to step away from the computer.
3. As an unsigned user with no internet connection I want to be able to set duration of work and break period and save my settings and set them as default in order to customize the application to my preferences.
4. As an unsigned user with no internet connection I want to be able to determine and save a custom list of work and break periods of different duration in order to customize the app to my daily work routine.
5. As an unsigned user with no internet connection I want to be able to import my picture (for example of plants) to be displayed when it's time to break in order to enable my eyes to rest.
